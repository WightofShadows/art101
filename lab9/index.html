		    <h1>Lab 9 JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		      <p>In this lab we are introduced to DOM functionality, allowing us to
            edit HTML elements in Javascript. This was a bit more challenging
            than the rest - usually Ethan’s prior knowledge can help fill any
            gaps, however, as we were both unfamiliar with the material, this
            was completely new for both of us. We ran into small problems, but
            alike the rest of the labs, we quickly solved any problems and
            completed the material with little issue.</p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>Grasping how DOM manipulation works was a little bit tricky since
          neither of us are familiar with it. But by rereading the lectures and
          looking back at what we did in section, we were able to figure it out
          fairly quickly.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>Originally, we were typing document.body instead of outputEl, which
          printed out fine, but was outside of the border and not affected by
          the changes we made to outputEl’s css stylization. Beyond that, there
          were a few capitalization inconsistencies that had to be rooted out
          through inspecting the page.</p>
		    <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Here is the output:</p>
        <div id=output></div>
    </div>
  </body>

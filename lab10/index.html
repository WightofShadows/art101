		    <h1>Lab 10 JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		      <p>This lab focuses on using the addEventListener method in Javascript to add functionality to actions in HTML,
						i.e. through pressing a button. Reusing the Lab 7 sort() function we were able to make a website that takes a
						 userâ€™s input value and prints it in sorted order on screen. Starting out, we were a little confused on what
						 exactly this lab wanted us to do, but rereading the lecture slides gave us enough insight to finish
						 this lab without any major problems.</p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>This lab was slightly confusing at first - we had to go back to the lecture and review the slides
					just to get an idea of what you wanted from us in this lab. Thankfully, the slides were simple
					enough to understand, so we were quickly able to figure out what we needed to do.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>Occasionally, we got caught up in the Javascript, writing an unnecessary line or forgetting one,
					but by simultaneously testing and writing the js, allowed us to quickly identify any
					problems and fix them. </p>
		    <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Here is our search input:</p>
        <input type="search" id="user-name">Your name</input>
        <p>Here is the button:</p>
        <button id=my-button>Sort</button>
        <p>Here is the output:</p>
        <div id=output>My name, sorted!</div>
    </div>

		    <h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we use for loops and while loops to print numbers,
						 printing differently based on multiples. Overall, this lab was fairly simple.
					 No major problems. </p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>We had a slight mix up when we realized that the example code didn't
				exactly match up to what we wanted, but we were able to write the
        correct functions quickly enough by looking back at what we did in
        lecture, utilizing a few shortcuts in the example code. </p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>No problems, this lab was pretty simple. </p>

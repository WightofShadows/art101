        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p> This lab had us create a local file structure, add index.html files,
          and customize our website/homepage.
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p> Everything was pretty straightfoward, so it was difficult to mess up.
          However, occasionally, we ran into a small error - having an extra character or something
          that prevented the changes we wanted to see. Other than that though, as said before, it was fairly easy.
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>We got our file structure here:</p>

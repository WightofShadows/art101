		    <h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we used AJAX to get info from an external source,
						specifically the numbers API. First we had to find an API,
						pick and endpoint, and then test it. Once we had that
						in order, we used a combination of jQuery and AJAX to
						 create a button that fetches an output from our API. </p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>Honestly, this lab was really hard to understand for both of us. We
          were a bit confused on what exactly you wanted from us regarding the
          API’s, and also had trouble with using AJAX. AJAX is still a bit murky
          in terms of understanding, but we finished the lab regardless. It
          seemed that most of our misunderstanding stemmed from the lack of
          specificity with the APIs, and the lectures not really explaining it
          enough. Going ahead and reading the following lecture, for Thursday,
          cleared some things up, but it was a bit frustrating to see that this
          lecture occurred after the lab, and not before.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>Several of these - first of all, we had to download a CORS unblock
          and atom live server, and the server still didn’t run for Christian.
          Additionally, finding an API to use AJAX from was confusing, so we
          ended up using the numbers API from lecture as a last resort just to
          see if we could get something working. We were able to get the button
          to print random sets of info for random numbers in seemingly JSON
          format but are still not sure if this result is anything close to what
          you were asking for.</p>

		    	<h1>Lab 11 Libraries & jQuery</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we are being introduced to jQuery and its syntax to
						simplify our Javascript code. This lab was a bit more complex than
						the rest, first we had to put each section: challenges, problems,
						and results into their own div with their own ids, and then link the
						latest version of jQuery at the top. Using jQuery was new for us
						both, we had to go through some trial and error in figuring out
						what lines of code would work for this lab. Going over the lectures
						helped us, and soon we were able to add the buttons, click events,
						and toggle class specials. Once we tested again, and made sure
						everything was in order, we took our screenshots and finished up
						the lab.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="challenges">
			    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    	<p>This lab was quite challenging; we struggled creating buttons
						without actually inserting them in the html, and we also ran into
						some problems with adding the click events. Toggling the specials
						was also a bit daunting, but again, alike all the previous difficult
						labs, Ethanâ€™s prior knowledge and expertise allowed us to complete
						the lab efficiently and quickly.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="problems">
		    	<h1>Problems</h1>
		    	<p>Ran into some problems using jQuery at first - creating the buttons
						and adding the click events was somewhat an issue at the beginning
						 of this lab. Going through the lectures helped us immensely,
						 however.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="results">
		    	<h1>Results</h1>
        	<p>The buttons in here were added through jQuery, as were their
						functions.</p>

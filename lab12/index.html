		    <h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we test out if-else statements in Javascript to build
					a sorting hat function. This also introduces the mod operator (%) to
					sort houses based on string length (every 4 characters). Lab was straightforward,
					 little to no challenges/problems encountered. </p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>Nothing was particularly challenging in this lab, lectures were clear to
				follow, and the examples posted in the lab were extremely helpful.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>Minor mishaps with some parentheses and having an extra line of code, nothing
				substantial. </p>
		    <h1>Results</h1>
        <p></p>

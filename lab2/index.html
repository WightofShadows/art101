		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>YO. My name is Christian Oda and I am a fourth year art major. I'm taking this class
		really just to fill out units, but I am interested in learning some of the basics of code. My general interests
		include... drawing (of course), playing video games on the occasion, reading books, and watchin movies. Exciting.  </p>
		<p>Heyo, my name is Ethan Chen and I'm a third year intending to switch to an AGPM major from CS:GD.
		I'm taking the class as an elective and to expand my knowledge of programming/scripting - I didn't realize
		going in but some of this HTML and CSS stuff is similar to what I have done working on wikis for mods of various
		games. Anyway my hobbies would include sci fi reading, writing weird stream-of-consciousness stuff, this paragraph
		is going on too long but yeah that's my jam.</p>

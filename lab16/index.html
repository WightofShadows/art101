		    <h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we used AJAX to retrieve JSON data from the XKCD API.
						Similar to the last lab, we used an API and tested its endpoint.
						Once we collected the data from the endpoint using AJAX, we printed
						the title, image, and alt text on our webpage.</p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>Like the last lab, we were very confused at first, but going over the
					lecture and section material again cleared everything up. We realized
					the exact end goal was to get information from the JSON tags and put
					them into our own variables. This allowed us to complete the lab,
					albeit, still with some struggles.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>As said above, we had some problems at the beginning of the lab - we
					didn’t really know what exactly we were doing at first. We thought
					this was nearly the same as the last lab, where we had a button print
					out the data/webpage, but thankfully, the lectures/section helped us
					in understanding this lab. We also had some hiccups with the
					Javascript, there was a lot of testing and debugging involved, moreso
					compared to our other labs.</p>
				<p>Near the end of the lab, we also ran into issues with having the
					text appear when hovering over the image - instead of the full
					sentence, it only printed the first two words. Again, this was a bit
					puzzling, but Ethan realized that it was a problem with the string -
					the apostrophes used in the alt “confused” the quotes, so to speak.
					Ethan was able to identify this problem, and fixed it by flipping
					the quotes and apostrophes.</p>

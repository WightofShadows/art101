		    <h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		      <p>In this lab we make use of anonymous functions and callbacks, applied
            with use of the setTimeout() function.</p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>Once again the clear instructions made this lab easy to follow.
				There was a slight bit of confusion on the purpose of anonymous functions
				but it makes sense when you want to input a function that runs only once
				and can run as a parameter of something like setTimeout().</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>No problems, lab was straight forward and clear.</p>
		    <h1>Results</h1>
		    <p>Check out the console for the output.</p>

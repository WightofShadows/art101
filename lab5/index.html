	<h1>Lab 5 Data Types and Variables</h1>
	<img src="img/yield!.PNG" width="200"/>
	<p>In this lab we are beginning our main Javascript experience by learning basic
		data types that we assign to variables.</p>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>One was of us a little unfamilar with Javascript, thankfully, (Ethan) had prior knowledge,
	so he was able to easily explain the material in an understandable way. </p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>Other than the partial unfamiliarity with javascript, there were no significant
		problems overall - section went over the details of the assignment and that
		along with communication between us helped to understand variables.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>Our console results (Task 1):</p>
	<div>
		<img src="img/console.png" width=400/>
	</div>
	<p>Our javascript results:</p>
	<div>

	<p>Direct output of javascript:</p>

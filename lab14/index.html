		    <h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
		      <p>In this lab, we use our “debugging knowledge” to fix any previous
            labs which did not work. Fortunately for us, we didn’t have issues
            with our code in any of our labs, so we had to tackle the bonus,
            specifically, experimenting with debugger to create breakpoints in
            our code for the last lab (Lab 13). </p>
		    <h1>Challenges</h1>
		    <p>There wasn’t much challenge to this as we didn’t have any specific
          problems to fix and we’re just seeing what “debugger” does to our
          previous code. We couldn’t figure out much else to do.</p>
		    <h1>Problems</h1>
		    <p>Had a very minor problem where we weren’t really sure how to use the
          debugger properly, but we figured it out so quickly it's hardly even
          worth noting as a “problem.”</p>

        <h1>Debugging</h1>
        <p>Here are some images of our process. Again, there was nothing to
        "fix" exactly, we were just seeing how debugger worked. It stops
          code at the line it is put and pulls up the console - here you can see
          it at various places, which either prevents the fizzBuzz function from
          running entirely, or allows a for loop to only run once, etc.</p>

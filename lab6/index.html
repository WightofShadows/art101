		<h1>Lab 6 Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<img src="img/car.jpg" width="200"/>
		<p>In this lab we are putting JavaScript arrays to use alongside object
			oriented programming.</p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>While we had a decent idea of what we were doing from the start, there
			was definitely still challenge understanding how to declare objects. Once
			again Ethan was already familiar with the concepts of arrays and objects in other
			programming languages, though the syntax in JavaScript is still a little different
			and we had to get used to that.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>Getting our array and object to print out without errors took up some
			time, but it turned out to mostly just be an issue with how we had named
			and called our variables. We also didn't know how our object wasn't
			printing a list in the console output, and had to look it up to find we
			needed a different syntax:<br>
			<code>console.log("My Wheels:", myMainRide);</code><br>
			instead of:<br>
			<code>console.log("My Wheels: " + myMainRide);</code><br>
			Finally there was a stray parentheses in the .js on the second writeln,
			which had our heads scratching for quite a while as to how our script
			wasn't outputting :P</p>

		<ul>
			<li style="font-family:'Courier New'"><i>Jerd Cave</i> (pseudonym of Ethan Chen, powered by Diabolical Vasquez) was a
					simple fellow, before he got a burn scar and decided the only way to heal
					it was to blow himself up and regenerate. The plan almost worked exactly
					as intended, but unfortunately, Jerd regenerated around a metal pipe and
					it has since fused to his back forever. This caused Jerd to lose face, and
					ever since he's been trying to work his way back up the ranks of the WA"O"
					and earn some respect. Hasn't turned out well so far.</li>
